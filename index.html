            <p>The growth of technological advancement since the birth of internet, as early as 1982, shows us today that information can be access not only one way (as content creator upload without feedbacks) or two ways (as feedbacks are now accessible from user) but now three ways (as users can be the content creator also) through the help of social media. Therefore, the flow of information are more wider and easily accessible, resulting transparency in knowledge worldwide. Making awareness for a more innovative solution that helps current issues internationally.
            </p>
            <p>Based on a research done by Google and Temasek (2017) on 330 Million Internet Users Accelerating the Growth of Southeast Asia's Internet Economy the internet economy market size is expected to reach $200 billion in 2025 and the average time Southeast Asians spent on the internet every day is 3.6 hours every day. This impacts all industries in the world as internet can be accessed and used freely, including global fashion industry.
            </p>
            <p>Today's global fashion industry is marketed rapidly and its trend are volatile due to the growth of technological advancement mentioned above and the growth of Millennials. Millennials or Generation Y in this case is a collective term used to refer to those born between 1980 and 2000. This generation is a group of huge potential customers for fast fashion industry because Generation Y are quite fashion conscious, willing to consume two-thirds of their income on fashion products, less price conscious, are quite keen on hedonism, refer to word-of-mouth reviews, have a strong passion to try novelties, purchase more costly items and pay more than other age cohorts.
            </p>
            <p>The growth of these two factors together making fashion's marketers to focus more on segmenting their product in a more lean, flexible and greener way to answer their capabilities in competing with today's fashion industry. According to Forbes (2019), hundreds of lobbying groups are raising awareness and influencing consumer demand for drastic industry change. This has led to growing evidence that both Millennials and Gen Z are pushing for a new level of transparency around the ecological footprint and entire life cycle of all products.
            </p>
            <p>This age group are spoiled due to the rise of digital era that helps widen many individuals' taste of preference offered by fashion marketers through the use of digital marketing, as more people in this age group have easier access to internet via smartphones. According to Kompas (2019), active smartphone users in Indonesia grew from 55 million people in 2015 to 100 million people in 2018. With this number, Indonesia is the country with the fourth largest active smartphone users in the world after China, India and America. Today's smartphone users in Indonesia are dominated by the age of production called millennial generation (age 15-35 years).
